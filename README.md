# Holberton School Projects

This repository contains all the projects completed as part of the **Holberton School Software Engineering Foundation curriculum**.

---

## About This Path

- The curriculum is **foundational and comprehensive**, covering software engineering principles, low-level and high-level programming, web development, system engineering, and DevOps.  
- Organized in **sessions**, each session contains tasks/projects that are implemented according to Holberton instructions.  
- Projects are **reviewed and validated** through the Holberton platform.  
- The program develops skills in **C, Python, Web, Algorithms, Shell, Networking, System Engineering, Docker, React, and more**.
